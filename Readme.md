# Python Task
## Description
Complete the below tasks. Save your answer to each of these questions into a separate python file (i.e. 1.py, 2.py, 3.py, and 4.py) and submit them to Moodle. This should be your own individual work. We operate a zero-tolerance policy on plagiarism, collusion, generative Al tools, etc. The work should only require you to import sockets, http, and hashlib libraries. DO NOT IMPORT ANY OTHER LIBRARIES. The deadline for these is 27 December 2024, 23:59 Wuxi time, standard lateness penalties apply.
1. Create a python program that takes a URL of a website as a systems argument and prints the number of times the number 0 appears in the HTML document.
2. Create a python program that implements a TCP IPv4 socket server on 127.0.0.1, port
8080. For every instance of the number 0 that the server is sent, it echoes back a zero.
3. Create a TCP IPv4 socket server (on 127.0.0.1, port 8080) that accepts two connections.
Every message received by the server from the first connection is echoed to the second connection and vice versa.
4. Create a TCP IPv4 Socket server (on 127.0.0.1, port 8080) that listens for the client to send a string (of any length). The server then echoes back the hedigest of sha256 hash of the string.
